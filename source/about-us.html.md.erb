# About us

## Our clients

Our strengths and interests are an ideal match for small
technology companies that need the flexibility and adaptability
of a small team as well as very high talent and a high level of
engagement. Coincidentally, we are currently working with technology start-up
companies from the Silicon Valley.

## Technology transfer

We specialize in bridging the gap between scientific research and
deployable product: we can work with complex, under-documented
technology and we have the engineering and usability experience to bring
real products into the market.

## Effective virtual teams

Our team has many years of experience in
global, remote collaboration and has repeatedly succeeded at creating an
effective, tightly-knit day-to-day working experience with our
customers. In practice, we become an integral part of our customers'
development teams.

## Virtually close

Our timezone location (GMT-3) makes it easy to maintain
multiple-hour, sometimes full-day overlap with North American
and European customers. This further helps us work hand-in-hand
with our customers and be present during important
deadlines and deliverables.

## Quality people

Our engineers are carefully chosen for their
world-class software engineering skills. We keep them
interested by offering them the chance to work on
cutting-edge projects with international customers at the
forefront of technology innovation.

## Fast learners

We are passionate about technology. We love engaging in
opportunities for which we have to learn something new.
We dive into your project environment, understand it,
and work with you on it. Adapting quickly is one of
our key strengths.

## Technology expertise

We specialize in the following areas:

- Real-time Web application development

- Simple usable interfaces to complex systems

- Web robotics

- Android-based systems and applications

We have developed expertise in a variety of technologies,
including: JavaScript, Python, C++, Java, Android, HTML5,
ROS, Web Sockets, Socket.IO, Django, Ruby on Rails, Node,
Ember, Ansible, Git and many more
