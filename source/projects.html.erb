        <h2>Monitoring price changes around the world</h2>

        <p>
          Pricespot is the mobile application used to gather consumerâs prices and product data for <a href="http://www.premise.com" target="_blank">premise</a>, a company devoted to track macroeconomic and human trends in real time.
        </p>

        <p>
          We improved the <span class="label label-success">Android</span> mobile application design with the use of <span class="label label-success">Android Services</span> for data upload, enhanced UI interaction and integrated it with <span class="label label-success">Google Places API</span> for better location support.

        <h2>Porting ROS to Android devices</h2>

        <p>
          The aim of this project is to develop an autonomous robot system using <a href="http://wiki.ros.org" target="_blank">ROS</a> that executes entirely on an Android device.
        </p>

        <p>
          We contributed to <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/rosjava" target="_blank">ROS Java</a> by implementing a <a href="https://github.com/Ekumen/base_controller" target="_blank">base controller</a> from scratch, extend it to use the multiple radios instead of just WiFi and added the ability to create externally reachable masters in an <span class="label label-success">Android</span> device. We are also diving into <span class="label label-success">ROS internals</span> to isolate the minimum required modules for a robot to navigate autonomously. Depending on the situation we are re-implementing core functionality in <span class="label label-success">Java</span> or compiling existing sources with <span class="label label-success">Android NDK</span>.

        <h2>Implementing language bindings for airbrite.io</h2>

        <p>
          <a href="https://www.airbrite.io/" target="_blank">Airbrite.io</a> exposes a full e-commerce sollution to developers by means of a REST API, including product catalog, orders and online payments.
        </p>

        <p>
          We created API bindings for <span class="label label-success">Backbone.js</span> and <span class="label label-success">Python</span> and we are currently working on <span class="label label-success">Node.js</span>, <span class="label label-success">Ruby</span> and <span class="label label-success">PHP</span> versions.

        <h2>Inventing the next-generation user interfaces for autonomous robots</h2>

        <p>
          <a href="http://www.savioke.com/" target="_blank">Savioke</a> mission is to develop affordable, usable robots for the services industry.
        </p>

        <p>
          At Ekumen we are helping Savioke to develop top-quality user experiences for robot control, including autonomous navigation and teleoperation. Our approach is based on web user interfaces using <span class="label label-success">Meteor</span>, <span class="label label-success">JavaScript</span> and <span class="label label-success">Rosbridge</span>, a JSON transport layer included in the <span class="label label-success">Robot Web Tools</span> bundle.

        <h2>Live online video streaming</h2>

        <p>
          We are prototyping new content protection solutions for live video delivered over the Internet.
        </p>

        <p>
          For this project we use <span class="label label-success">Adobe Media Server</span> instances running in the <span class="label label-success">Amazon Cloud</span> and stream content via <span class="label label-success">HDS (HTTP Dynamic Streaming)</span>. The backend processing is implemented in <span class="label label-success">Python</span> and uses <span class="label label-success">MongoDB</span> for persistence.

        <h2>Bringing personal robots to the service industry</h2>

        <p>
          This project was a collaboration between Ekumen and <a href="http://www.willowgarage.com/">Willow Garage</a> to take their personal robots to the next level and turn them into products for customers such as hospitals or restaurants.
        </p>

        <p>
          We contributed with our expertise on <span class="label label-success">system integration</span> for bringing some of the existing modules and projects into the services market. We defined the system architecture and adapted the development infrastructure from an open source research project to a private product development business.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the UX level we created intuitive web interfaces for complex robotics problems using <span class="label label-success">Ember.js</span>, <span class="label label-success">Web Sockets</span> and the <span class="label label-success">Robot Web Tools</span> bundle. We also tackle the problem of non-expert users controlling robots under continuous operation and end-user robot programming.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the backend level we worked throughout the whole <span class="label label-success">ROS stack</span> using <span class="label label-success">C++</span> and <span class="label label-success">Python</span> to implement multiple robot networks (each one with its own master node) and extended the python client API. We also performed <span class="label label-success">kinematics analysis</span> on different client environments using <span class="label label-success">MoveIt!</span>.

        <h2>Real-time transcription by non-expert captionist crowdsourcing</h2>

        <p>
          Scribe collects audio from a mobile device and schedules workers to perform captioning on small audio segments.
        </p>

        <p>
          The distributed captions are then merged into a single text, returning a consolidated transcript to the mobile user.
        </p>

        <p>
          We worked with <span class="label label-success">Adobe Air</span> on the mobile client to stream audio to an <span class="label label-success">Adobe Media Server</span> and with <span class="label label-success">Javascript and AJAX</span> in the front-end worker application. Back-end development included creating diagnostic and debugging tools in a <span class="label label-success">LAMP Stack</span> as well as integrating with the <span class="label label-success">Java</span> process in charge of merging the distributed transcriptions.
