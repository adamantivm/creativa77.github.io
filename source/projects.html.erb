            We improved the <span class="label label-success">Android</span> mobile application design with the use of <span class="label label-success">Android Services</span> for data upload, enhanced UI interaction and integrated it with <span class="label label-success">Google Places API</span> for better location support.

          <span class="portfolio-item-title"> Porting ROS to Android devices. </span>
          <span class="portfolio-item-description">The aim of this project is to develop an autonomous robot system using <a href="http://wiki.ros.org" target="_blank">ROS</a> that executes entirely on an Android device.
          </span>
          <div class="portfolio-item-contributions">
            We contributed to <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/rosjava" target="_blank">ROS Java</a> by implementing a <a href="https://github.com/Ekumen/base_controller" target="_blank">base controller</a> from scratch, extend it to use the multiple radios instead of just WiFi and added the ability to create externally reachable masters in an <span class="label label-success">Android</span> device. We are also diving into <span class="label label-success">ROS internals</span> to isolate the minimum required modules for a robot to navigate autonomously. Depending on the situation we are re-implementing core functionality in <span class="label label-success">Java</span> or compiling existing sources with <span class="label label-success">Android NDK</span>.

        <div class="portfolio-item-contributions">
          We created API bindings for <span class="label label-success">Backbone.js</span> and <span class="label label-success">Python</span> and we are currently working on <span class="label label-success">Node.js</span>, <span class="label label-success">Ruby</span> and <span class="label label-success">PHP</span> versions.

        <div class="portfolio-item-contributions">
          At Ekumen we are helping Savioke to develop top-quality user experiences for robot control, including autonomous navigation and teleoperation. Our approach is based on web user interfaces using <span class="label label-success">Meteor</span>, <span class="label label-success">JavaScript</span> and <span class="label label-success">Rosbridge</span>, a JSON transport layer included in the <span class="label label-success">Robot Web Tools</span> bundle.

        <div class="portfolio-item-contributions">
          For this project we use <span class="label label-success">Adobe Media Server</span> instances running in the <span class="label label-success">Amazon Cloud</span> and stream content via <span class="label label-success">HDS (HTTP Dynamic Streaming)</span>. The backend processing is implemented in <span class="label label-success">Python</span> and uses <span class="label label-success">MongoDB</span> for persistence.

        <span class="portfolio-item-title">Bringing personal robots to the service industry. </span>
        <span class="portfolio-item-description">This project was a collaboration between Ekumen and <a href="http://www.willowgarage.com/">Willow Garage</a> to take their personal robots to the next level and turn them into products for customers such as hospitals or restaurants.
        </span>
        <div class="portfolio-item-contributions">
          <p>We contributed with our expertise on <span class="label label-success">system integration</span> for bringing some of the existing modules and projects into the services market. We defined the system architecture and adapted the development infrastructure from an open source research project to a private product development business. </p>

          <p>At the UX level we created intuitive web interfaces for complex robotics problems using <span class="label label-success">Ember.js</span>, <span class="label label-success">Web Sockets</span> and the <span class="label label-success">Robot Web Tools</span> bundle. We also tackle the problem of non-expert users controlling robots under continuous operation and end-user robot programming.</p>

          <p>At the backend level we worked throughout the whole <span class="label label-success">ROS stack</span> using <span class="label label-success">C++</span> and <span class="label label-success">Python</span> to implement multiple robot networks (each one with its own master node) and extended the python client API. We also performed <span class="label label-success">kinematics analysis</span> on different client environments using <span class="label label-success">MoveIt!</span>.</p>
