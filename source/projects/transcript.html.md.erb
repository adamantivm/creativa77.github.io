Scribe collects audio from a mobile device and schedules workers to perform
captioning on small audio segments.


The distributed captions are then merged into a single text, returning a
consolidated transcript to the mobile user.

We worked with <%= tag_link "Adobe Air" %> on the mobile client to stream audio
to an <%= tag_link "Adobe Media Server" %> and with <%= tag_link "Javascript" %>
and <%= tag_link "AJAX" %> in the front-end worker application.



Back-end development included creating diagnostic and debugging tools in a
<%= tag_link "LAMP Stack" %> as well as integrating with the
<%= tag_link "Java" %> process in charge of merging the distributed
transcriptions.
