Scribe is a research project led by researcher <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jbigham/" target="_blank">Jeff Bigham</a>
that collects audio from a mobile device and schedules workers to perform captioning on small audio segments. 
The distributed captions are then merged into a single text, returning a
consolidated transcript to the mobile user.

We worked with Adobe Air on the mobile client to stream audio
to an Adobe Media Server and with <%= tag_link "javascript" %>
and AJAX in the front-end worker application. 
Back-end development included creating diagnostic and debugging tools in a
LAMP Stack as well as integrating with the <%= tag_link "java" %> process in
charge of merging the distributed transcriptions.
