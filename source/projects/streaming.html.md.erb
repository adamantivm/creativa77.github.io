For this project we created new content protection solutions for live video delivered
over the Internet, using Adobe Media Server instances running in the Amazon Cloud and
streaming content via HDS (HTTP Dynamic Streaming).

The back-end processing is implemented in <%= tag_link "Python" %> and uses
<%= tag_link "mongo" %> for persistence.
