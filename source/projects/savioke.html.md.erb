Savioke's robots have been delighting hotel guests and curious visitors alike for a while now:

 - Link 1
 - Link 2

At Ekumen we are working closely with Savioke, contributing to different
parts of their software stack:

We are contributing to the robots <%= tag_link "autonomous navigation" %> and <%= tag_link "localization" %>
software based on (<%= tag_link "ROS" %>). These two components allow the robot to move autonomously
sharing the space with people in constantly-changing unstructured environments.

We have also developed with Saviokeâ€™s Web team a complete solution
to monitor and manage the fleet of distributed robot across different hotels.
This includes  integrating Javascript with ROS by means of roslibjs, a soft
real-time robot operations center based on <%= tag_link "MeteorJs" %> and data gathering and
analysis using <%= tag_link "Elasticsearch" %>.
