We joined TORK to help them bring online a 3D <%= tag_link "ROS" %> visualisation application that uses 
sensor data and allows to manipulate the model from the client. For this application 
we created a <%= tag_link "Ruby on Rails" %> application for managing users and balancing Amazon EC2 
instances based on the required simulation load.
