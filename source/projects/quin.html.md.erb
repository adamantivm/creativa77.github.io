The aim of this project is to develop an autonomous robot system using
<a href="http://wiki.ros.org" target="_blank">ROS</a> that executes entirely on an Android device.


We contributed to <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/rosjava" target="_blank">ROS Java</a> by implementing a
<a href="https://github.com/creativa77/base_controller" target="_blank">base controller</a> from scratch,
extend it to use the multiple radios instead of just WiFi and added the ability
to create externally reachable masters in an <%= tag_link "Android" %> device.

After a first success with ground vehicles navigation we adapted the web interface 
for flying drones, helped creating the communication system between the interface 
and the drone and adapting the Pixhawk onboard computer project to that system.
We also developed an autonomous mission teleoperation App (Android) for flying 
vehicles with live video feed and waypoint support.
