Here at Ekumen we encourage innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship.
[Spin-offs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_spin-off) are a way to bring
to life projects whose potential is best realized on an environment of their own.
Today we are proud to announce the first Creativa spin-off:
[LESS](http://lessindustries.com).

Four months ago, in a bar, Lucas, Elvio and Sebastian were talking about
[Internet of Things](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things) and how it
really is just about robotics. That day, the LESS project was born.

LESS is a cloud-based telemetry system. Tiny little and cheap computers equipped
with various sensors that sends all the data about what is happening around them
via the omnipresent mobile network to the cloud in order to generate reports,
send emails and trigger alarms.


Data Centers, medical centers and the agriculture industry can benefit from
this versatile and affordable technology.


LESS has created itâ€™s own hardware to fit the client's needs and reduce costs.
In their first contract, LESS' computers will be monitoring hundreds of silo bags worth US$40.000 each.


We want to congratulate the LESS team and hope to see a new milestone in the
Internet of Things and robotics.
