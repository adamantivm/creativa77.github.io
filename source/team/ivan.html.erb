    <p>
      Very curious, he loves challenges and learning new things. This has led
      him to participate on a lot of unusual projects ranging from simulating
      the behavior of ants with emergent systems to experiment with neural
      networks. In his free time he enjoys playing the piano, doing archery and
      reading science fiction novels.
